<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>easy-rsa is a CLI utility to build and manage a PKI CA. In laymen's terms,
this means to create a root certificate authority, and request and sign 
certificates, including intermediate CAs and certificate revocation lists (CRL).</p>

<h1>Branch structure</h1>
<p>The easy-rsa master branch is currently tracking development for the 3.x release
cycle. Please note that, at any given time, master may be broken.  Feel free to
create issues against master, but have patience when using the master branch.  It
is recommended to use a release, and priority will be given to bugs identified in
the most recent release.</p>
<p>The prior 2.x and 1.x versions are available as release branches for
tracking and possible back-porting of relevant fixes. Branch layout is:</p>
<pre><code>master         &lt;- 3.x, at present
v3.x.x            pre-release branches, used for staging branches
release/2.x
release/1.x
</code></pre>
<p>LICENSING info for 3.x is in the <a href="COPYING.md">COPYING.md</a> file</p>
